### Number systems

- All data is represented by a bunch of grouped cells of o's and 1's memory
- As the range of your data grows, so will the number of digits you nedd ro represent the data memory
- Hexadecimal system makes it a little easier for humans to handle streams of data with 1's and 0's
- Octal has the same goal as Hexadecimal, but it's almost no longer used in modern times, it's just mentioned here for awareness.

- Binary: 2
- Octal: 8 (group of 3 binary)
- Decimal: 10
- Hexadecimal: 16 (group of 4 binary)
