### Precedence and Associativity

- [Precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence) (which operation to do first) of calculation: `* / + -`

- Associativity (which direction or which order) define you do the calculation from the left or from the right. `a/b*c`  = `(a/b)*c` (associated from left to right), use `()` to make it clear which operator will be done first.
