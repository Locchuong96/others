**run the container attach and detach mode**

- `attach mode`: `sudo docker run [your_image]` meaning when you run the container the output will display on the terminal,
if you want to attack the container again `sudo docker attach [your_container_token]`

- `detach mode`: `sudo docker run -d [your_image]` meaning when you run the container, it will run in the behind, so you can not see anything
